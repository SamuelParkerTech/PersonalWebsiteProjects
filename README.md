# SPTECH-Personal-Projects
Samuel Parker Personal Projects 


A space for me to create my own code and fun projects. 

Currently working on my Personal Website while I learn.

Index.html - current website progress.

WIP2 - A place to try more experimental new website or new styles.

Sandbox - A Creative place with ever changing code just to experiment further without affecting changes in the personal project or WIP2. Changes here may be applied to the index or WIP2.
